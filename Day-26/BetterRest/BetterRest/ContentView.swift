 When do they want to wake up?
 Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
 How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

         Notes: The following way we can create a Date Picker.
         But there are two problems with date picker by default.
         1)The label => "Please enter a Date?" by default will comes on the left side, even if you give empty string also date picker will allocate same default space. it will look ugly. For this, we can put the Date Picker in the "Form"
         And if you dont want to put into the Form, then go with
         DatePicker("Please enter a Date?", selection: $wakeup).labelHidden()
         */

//        Form { //This looks much better than normal one. But there is some UI-Glitch will be appearing when it comes and goes
        //displayedComponents will give us an option what type of things you want to pick from the date.
        /*And also possible to give a range to pick the date BUT THIS IS OLD FASHIONED WAY.
        let today = Date()
